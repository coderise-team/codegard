"""
Consume judge results from Redis and apply verdicts to submissions.

The judge worker pushes a `SubmissionResponse` (JSON) onto `judge:results`.
This long-running management command is the last link in the chain: it reads
that queue with a blocking `BLMOVE`, applies the verdict via `instance.save()`
(which fires the `post_save` signals — score recalc + websocket push), and
reliably drains the queue.

Mirrors `judge/app/worker.py` (reliable queue: blmove → processing → lrem,
recover_orphans, dead-letter), but synchronous and on the Django side.
